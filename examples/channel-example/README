Provision a server with a channel
==================

The application will use the latest version of the org.wildfly:wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack to provision the postgresql-datasource.
The version of the JDBC driver for PostGreSQL that is provisioned will be the latest 42.x available.
The datasource-channel.yaml defines the versioning constraints to fetch these two artifacts from Maven.
